This project builds several programs that batch factor integers and
collects stats on them.

The implementation of SQUFOF is an adaptation to 64-bit and 128-bit
fixed sized integers taken from the source code for Pari/GP available
at http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/ (Accessed April 10th, 2013).

I assume no credit for the SQUFOF code, accept no liability, and offer
no warranty.
