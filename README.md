This project builds several programs that batch factor integers and
collects stats on them.

The implementation of SQUFOF is an adaptation to 64-bit and 128-bit
fixed sized integers from an implementation taken from the source code
for Pari/GP available at http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/
(Access April 10th, 2013).

I assume no credit for the SQUFOF code, accept no liability, and offer
no warranty.
